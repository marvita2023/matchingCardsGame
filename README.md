The Memory Card Game is a classic concentration game where players flip over pairs of cards to find matching images. The objective is to match all pairs of cards in the shortest number of moves possible. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid where each cell contains a hidden animal image. The images are randomly placed in pairs across the board. When the game starts, all images are hidden.


•	How to Play


	Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the hidden image.
	Click on another card to flip it over as well.
	If the two flipped cards match, they will remain face-up.
	They will flip back face down if the two flipped cards do not match.
	Continue flipping pairs of cards until all cards are matched.
	Try to match all pairs with the fewest moves possible.
	When all cards are matched, you’ll get a “Congratulations, you won!” message on the screen. Then, you can restart the game by clicking the Restart button and play again!
